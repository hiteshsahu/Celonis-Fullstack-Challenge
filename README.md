# Celonis Labs Full-stack Challenge

Dear candidate,

Welcome to the Celonis Labs full-stack challenge.
We have prepared a small project for you to review and improve.

Goal of this challenge is to have a base for discussion during a challenge review meeting.

## The situation
Just imagine this is a real project you're assigned to.
It was written by a junior developer who left the company.
Unexpectedly, thanks to this project, the company's revenue increased dramatically.

You're told that there are problems with this:
* It is hard to start the application
* The application has different bugs

Given the limitation of not spending more than 2-3h with this, what would you highlight during a challenge interview?
How do you approach the problems?

### Result

The result is open, it's up to you. However, you are free and welcome to ask us any question.

Please provide your result 24 hours before the scheduled interview so we can have a look and come prepared to the meeting.
You will start the interview by leading the presentation and explaining the results.
Afterward, we will continue with a discussion about interesting aspects.

## The project

This project is a small application to manage users for multiple tenants. It is split up into two components:

- `server`: A small node.js app that offers an API able to perform the required operations
- `angular`: An angular application that provides a UI to enable a good experience for the user management. It consumes the API.


### Issues

As mentioned before, the project is hard to start and it appears there are different bugs present.

### Potential enhancements

One of this project's stakeholders complained about the inability to associate users with tenants.
